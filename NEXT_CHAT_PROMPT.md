# Portfolio Website - Development Continuation Prompt

## Context
I'm building a personal portfolio website (React + TypeScript + Tailwind) that showcases my development projects and photography. Planning phase is complete.

## Project Location
`D:\Projects\Portfolio`

## What's Done
- README.md with full project spec (profile data, design system, structure)
- PROTOTYPE_PROMPT.md with build instructions

## What Needs to Happen Now
1. Scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript project in `D:\Projects\Portfolio`
2. Install dependencies: `tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite framer-motion lucide-react react-router-dom`
3. Configure Tailwind v4 with dark theme (bg: #0a0a0a, accent: #d4a853, text: #e5e5e5)
4. Build all 6 sections as components:
   - Hero (full viewport, name, tagline, scroll indicator)
   - About (brief intro)
   - Projects (2 cards: Lutem + SQL Scrolls)
   - Skills/Experience (tech badges, timeline)
   - Photography (placeholder grid)
   - Contact (email, LinkedIn, GitHub icons)
5. Fixed navbar with smooth scroll navigation
6. Basic Framer Motion fade-in animations

## Important Notes
- Read the README.md and PROTOTYPE_PROMPT.md files first for full context
- Use Desktop Commander for all file operations
- Use Context7 for React/Tailwind/Framer Motion docs
- Placeholder content is fine - just need the structure working
- Dark, moody aesthetic - warm amber accent color

## Start Command
```bash
cd D:\Projects\Portfolio
# Read the existing files, then scaffold and build
```

Go ahead and build the prototype. Get something running I can see in the browser.
